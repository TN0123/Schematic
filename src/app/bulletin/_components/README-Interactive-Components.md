# Interactive Dynamic Components for Notes

This implementation adds several new interactive component types to your dynamic notes system, significantly expanding the variety and flexibility of notes that can be created.

## New Component Types

### 1. Knowledge Graph (`graph`)

- **File**: `SimpleGraph.tsx`
- **Description**: Interactive force-directed graph for connecting concepts and ideas
- **Features**:
  - Add/delete nodes
  - Create connections between nodes
  - Visual force simulation using react-force-graph-2d
  - Node selection and editing
  - Automatic layout and positioning

### 2. Hierarchical Tree (`tree`)

- **File**: `InteractiveTree.tsx`
- **Description**: Collapsible tree structure for organizing information hierarchically
- **Features**:
  - Add child nodes to any parent
  - Expand/collapse branches
  - Edit node names inline
  - Delete nodes (with all children)
  - Visual indentation for hierarchy levels

### 3. Process Flowchart (`flowchart`)

- **File**: `InteractiveFlowchart.tsx`
- **Description**: SVG-based flowchart for documenting processes and workflows
- **Features**:
  - Multiple node types (start, process, decision, end)
  - Connect nodes with arrows
  - Drag nodes to reposition
  - Different shapes for different node types
  - Visual connection mode

### 4. Mind Map (`mindmap`)

- **File**: `InteractiveMindMap.tsx`
- **Description**: Radial mind map for brainstorming and visual thinking
- **Features**:
  - Central node with radiating branches
  - Multiple levels of hierarchy
  - Color-coded nodes
  - Automatic positioning in radial layout
  - Click-to-edit node text

## AI Integration

The AI prompt system has been updated to understand and generate these new component types:

- **Updated prompts** in `generate-schema.ts` and API route
- **Validation** for all new component types
- **Smart suggestions** based on user descriptions

## Usage Examples

Users can now describe notes like:

- "Create a knowledge map of machine learning concepts"
- "Make a decision tree for troubleshooting"
- "Design a workflow for the review process"
- "Build a mind map for project planning"

## Technical Implementation

### Type Safety

- All components have proper TypeScript interfaces
- Data structures are validated on both client and server
- Consistent naming conventions across components

### Integration

- Seamlessly integrated into existing `BulletinDynamic.tsx`
- Uses the same auto-save and state management system
- Compatible with dark mode and existing styling

### Performance

- Efficient rendering using React best practices
- Debounced saves to prevent excessive API calls
- Lightweight SVG and Canvas rendering

## Benefits

1. **Increased Variety**: From 7 to 11 component types (57% increase)
2. **Visual Thinking**: Support for different cognitive styles
3. **Complex Relationships**: Ability to model connections and hierarchies
4. **Interactive Editing**: Real-time manipulation of visual structures
5. **AI-Powered**: Intelligent component suggestions based on descriptions

This upgrade transforms your notes app from simple text-based entries to a powerful visual thinking and knowledge management tool.
